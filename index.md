Welcome to my landing page, which serves mainly to direct people to other places I'm likely to be on the web.



I'm a technical writer with some background in energy policy, philosophy, and politics. At some point I'll link to personal projects and other things I'm involved in here. Until then, your best bet for learning more about me is to look me up in one of the places listed below.



I live in Frederick, Maryland with my wife and son.
